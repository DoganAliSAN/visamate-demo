#Project is perfectly fine at the moment expectations of the customer is met
#But customer is ending the job between us do to finding another app to use 
#Customer also pays 1/3 of the agreed price 
#since we didn't signed a contract in between, unwillingly i'm accepting this number
#by making this a life lesson i'm putting this project to shelf 
#looking to future i believe in myself to do better and i have hope to see huge improvement on my company
#Good Luck future me.
